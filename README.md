# Project Title 
Master-Your-Memory

## Introduction

Master	your	memory	is	a	memory	game	derived	 from	cognitive	 tasks	 to	enhance	 the	playerâ€™s different	mental	skills.	This	app	is	composed	of	three	levels	of	difficulty,	Easy,	Medium	and	Hard.	Additionally,	the	app	enables	the	player	to	select	cards	in	different	categories	like	animals,	icecreams,etc.	There	is	a	provision	for	the	players	to	view	high	score.	While	doing	so	the	player	can	also	create	his	profile	where	he	can	manage	background	sounds	and	other	settings.	So,	when	a	player	selects	a	certain	category	the	background	changes	accordingly.	For	example,	if	a	player	chooses	 cards	 from	 animal	 category	 to	 be	 displayed	 the	 background	 will	 have	 some	 kind	 of	feature	that is	related	to	animals.	
Thus,	it	is	an	app	for	kids	and	adults	to	get	a	brain	work	out	anywhere,	anytime.
